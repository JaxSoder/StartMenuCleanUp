# StartMenuCleanUp1.0

This is a fairly simple program that helps access your Start Menu on Windows 10 to be able to view all of the programs and delete which ones you desire. There is probably a much easier way of doing this but I wanted to program something so here it is. Have a good day -Jax

# Setup

Download the Zip file and head into "StartMenuCleanUp1.0\StartMenuCleanUp1.0\bin\Debug" to launch the StartMenuCleanUp1.0.exe

# How To Use

Start by clicking the "Seach Start Menu" button then select what program you would like to delete from your start menu and click the "Delete" button.
