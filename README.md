# StartMenuCleanUp1.0

This is a fairly simple program that helps access your Start Menu on Windows 10 to be able to view all of the programs and delete which ones you desire. There is probably a much easier way of doing this but I wanted to program something so hear it is. Have a good day -Jax

# Setup

Download the Zip file and head into "StartMenuCleanUp1.0\StartMenuCleanUp1.0\bin\Debug" to launch the StartMenuCleanUp1.0.exe
